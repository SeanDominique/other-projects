Hi Chai,

I've uploaded a couple scripts of some of the work I've done previously. I hope it gives you some understanding of my current experience, and helps you determine how I may be able to help you and the team at Lenexa Medical out. 
Very eager to learn more and happy to dive into a specific direction depending on what you need!

### You'll find the following:
EEG folder contains:


### Signal_Processing
** Note ** these scripts I worked on in collaboration with other team members

- EEG_Signal_Analysis_MENTALAB.py
  Process, Filter and Visualise EEG data

- EEG_signal_processing.ipynb
  Process, Filter, Visualise and classify EEG data for Error-related potential detection.
  


### Exerpient_Data
- MI_trials
  EEG Data measured during an experiement performing motor imagery
- OE-CE_trials
  EEG Data measured during an experiment opening and closing eyes

  

### Experiment_Scripts
- circle_v3.ino
  Arduino script to control a mini prototype wheelchair wirelessly

- Get_IP.ino
  Arduino script to get IP and Port number from ESP32 arduino

- P300_Experiment.py
  Dynamic display for experiment to trigger P300 (type of EEG signal)

- Record_EEG.py
  Record and save EEG data using pylsl

- WC_Experiment_MENTALAB.py
  Script to run experiment to measure Motor Imagery signals and Error-related potentials. Controls wheelchair, dynamic display, and EEG data recording.

  
### Other

- DHF-webapp.tsx
  Webapp to record user input in firebase, and link them to a survey.

- OOP/project1-2
Made a game for a uni assignment.


I've also worked in C, MATLAB, and LabVIEW.
